analysis tools for coronavirus

I did this for myself because I wanted to be able to see the time lines for different countries and regions on top of each other, and also see the numbers normalized for population.  This is very early and work in progress.

need some form of python 3

install plotly

use submodule for raw_data which comes from John Hopkins repo:

git submodule init raw_data

git submodule update
